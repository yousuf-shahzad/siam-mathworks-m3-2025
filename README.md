# SIAM Mathworks M3 2025 - Hot Button Issue: Staying Cool as the World Heats Up

## Overview

This repository contains our team's solution for the 2025 SIAM MathWorks Math Modeling (M3) Challenge, addressing the urgent issue of extreme heat events and their impacts on urban populations. Our focus is on the City of Memphis, where we developed data-driven models to help city authorities better prepare for and mitigate the effects of heat waves.

## Problem Statement

As global temperatures rise, cities face increasing threats from prolonged and severe heat waves. Our challenge was to model and analyze:

1. **Indoor Temperature Dynamics:**  
   Estimating how indoor temperatures in non-air-conditioned homes evolve during heat waves, highlighting critical periods of heat risk.

2. **Peak Energy Demand:**  
   Predicting the cityâ€™s peak electricity demand during heat events, considering historical data and future projections.

3. **Community Heat Vulnerability:**  
   Developing a vulnerability index based on socioeconomic and environmental factors to identify and support the most at-risk neighborhoods.
